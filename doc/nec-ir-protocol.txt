When a key is pressed on a remote control using the NEC protocol,
a first message is sent to identify the key (the "command message") 
and a second one to indicate that key was pressed (the "keypress 
message").

Then, if the key remains pressed, another keypress message is sent 
every 100ms until the key is released.

Each message begins with a leader consisting of a 9ms carrier burst 
followed by a 4.5ms pause for a command message, or 2.21ms for 
a keypress message. Both types of messages end with a trailing 579us 
carrier burst.

There is a 39.7ms delay between the command message and the first 
keypress message, and a 95.7ms delay before any subsequent keypress 
messages.

A keypress message is self sufficient, but a command message conveys 
a 4 data byte payload between its leader and trailer.

Data bytes are sent LSB first. Data byte 1 is byte 0's complement, 
and byte 3 is byte 2's complement, meaning all command messages have 
the exact same duration.

Data bits begin with a 579us carrier burst followed by a pause 
depending on their value, 546us for a logical 0, and 1671us for 
a logical 1.

The frequency of the carrier is 38kHz with a duty cycle of 33.3%, 
i.e. the signal remains high for 8.77us every 26.315789us.
